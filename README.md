# JoesRobotShop

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.0.


## Devon's notes:
Lacking a proper microservice and database, we are using an express server with fake data hard-coded into it. 

Start the express server: cd to `api-server`.  
That has its own README.  
Run `npm start` there. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

Note: might also need to install the express server separately that they have included in the api-server directory.  I don't think just doing ng build will do that or us.  Not sure.  See the README there, too. 

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
